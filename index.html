        <div class="main-text multi-column">
	<a href="https://resume.averydorgan.com">
            <p>Avery Dorgan has decided to publish his own newspaper in a bizarre attempt to improve his employability. Dorgan, 26, writing in the third person, wanted to showcase his creative and technical skills to create one of the most unique digital resumes of our time. Trained as an EMT in 2011, Dorgan graduated from the University of Vermont in 2015 with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology. Though accepted as a health extension volunteer for Peace Corps Paraguay leaving the following February, Dorgan required emergency surgery preventing him from serving.</p>
            <p>Dorgan instead pursued a Master of Public Health (MPH) degree at New York University. This MPH took him from New York, NY to Accra, Ghana, to Abu Dhabi, UAE. It was through this program that he began to appreciate both public health in different contexts, but also how important learning is. After graduation, he worked for a time doing global health research before transitioning into Instructional Design, where he is currently.</p>
            <p> "I want to help improve access to education," he said in an interview. "Education opens so many doors and offers so many opportunities. No one should be deprived that right." He plans to continue fighting to ensure availability of educaiton in every community, both in a traditional sense, and using emerging technologies. <a href="https://resume.averydorgan.com">More information can be found on his resume.</a></p>

	  <h4>Internet Archive Under Attack!</h4>
	  <div class="multi-column">
        <p>The Internet Archive, the 501(c)3 organization behind the Wayback Machine and the Open Library, among others, has been sued for copyright infringement. Four major book publishers have alleged the organization's efforts to "provide Universal Access to All Knowledge" constitute a lack of respect for copyright law. The organization had organized a special branch of their library with over 1.3 million works that were publicly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. This branch forwent the organization's usual controlled lending policies in order to allow increased borrowing.</p>

            <p>The Essential PH1 has received initial support from postmarketOS. Postmarket aims to give a 10 year lifespan to Android-based phones. While not currently suitable for most people, the touch-optimized version of Alpine Linux hopes to provide mainline kernel support for mobile phones.</p>
	    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>Essential, the company behind PH1, was created by Android co-founder Andy Rubin with the aim of giving users more control over their device. In February 2020, Essential announced they would be closing, making support from postmarketOS essential.</p>

                    <div class="multi-column-5">
                        <p>After creating a news website from scratch, including more articles about himself than have previously been written, a more than slightly irritable developer seems to be at the end of his rope. There are a total of 32 pens to date... well, 33, if you count this one too. What can you expect in this collection? The hidden gems, in my totally unbiased opinion, are <a href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/wbyVWr" target="_blank">the recreation of the Pac-Man layout</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/pen/wbyVWr" target="_blank">coupons inspired by junk mail</a>. A lot of joke items of things that shouldn't be done in CSS Grid, such as <a href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/PXGgMG" target="_blank">a shelf</a>? <a href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/qggOog" target="_blank">Bathroom tiles wtf</a>? and <a href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/bOWqbj" target="_blank">makeup palettes </a>. If you are a cultured person, you will have a chance to enjoy a couple of pens inspired by <a href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/JxVZpX" target="_blank">Harry Potter  </a>and <a href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/RwNdeeQ" target="_blank">Pokemon.</a> On the rare occasion that you are looking at this profile for something you can use in production, you really shouldn't. But, there are <em> some   </em>real-world applications, such as <a href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/GPXozx" target="_blank">the recipe layout</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/pqoEoJ" target="_blank">the product catalog</a>, and <a href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/XyqQYL" target="_blank">color palettes for a style guide</a>.</p>

	        <p>With the exception of Maps, Drive, and Android, Google has all been replaced in the daily life of a local hobbyist. Self-hosted services have taken their place, mostly on local machines running Linux. "Is it the most secure system out there? Of course not. But I like the challenge of setting up these programs and cutting Google out of my life as much as possible," says the hobbyist, who has requested to remain anonymous. "The more I learn, the more independent I'm becoming!"</p>

		<h5>Man who slept with books as a child becomes expert in education</h5>
	        <p>While it's not uncommon for children to sleep with stuffed animals, one man's obsession with books took precedence when he was younger. The man professes he used to sleep with a collection of books by his side. He claims his love of books has spurred him to pursue a career in education in hopes of bringing his love of books to a new generation. Taking his passion one step further, the man tells us he recently applied to Librarian School.</p>
